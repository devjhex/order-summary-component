## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Planning the markup for your project is the perfect way to start and approach a project because it makes it so easy to work out and implement which is the opposite when you just dive into code without planning.

### Useful resources

- [The box shadow generator](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped me to easily get a box shadow for a part of the component which i highly recommend.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing site for references for all the properties used in css and many other things that i highly recommend.
